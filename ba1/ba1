Question #4:
4a. It depends on the error presented but symptoms make file commands in the wrong order, could be build failures, long build times, missing dependencies/missing files needed for the build, conflicts where a function might rely on another that has not been generated yet, or multiple instantiations of object files being called by the linker.

4b. Make file is broken into chunks, and each chunk is a recipe, and the recipes have a target: dependency format. The dependency tree is based on the build process where we need to take a .c file preprocess, compile it into assembly .s, assemble it into an object file .o and finally link it into an executable. The file is read from top to bottom to gather data, but after, it does a dependency analysis and analyzes the relationships between the targets and the dependencies. Based on the analysis it utilizes topological sorting to arrange the targets into a proper execution order.

4c. Things that may undermine the make file algorithm would be: modifying the make file during execution, failing to specify all dependencies, innaccurate time stamps, incorrect use of the makefile structured rules, creating temporary files during the build steps and not tracking them properly as dependencies, or cleaning them properly.
